Code to reproduce the simulation study results in Section 5 or 6 of `A novel approach to assess the predictiveness of a continuous
biomarker in early phases of drug development'. The repository contains the following R scripts:

1. Bmk_pred_value_logistic.R: main script to reproduce the results under the logistic relationship between overall response rate and biomarker. It calls the functions contained in the folder `functions_approaches'.
2. Bmk_pred_value_stepfunction.R: main script to reproduce the sensitivity analyses results under the step function relationship between overall response rate and biomarker. It calls the functions contained in the folder `functions_approaches'.
